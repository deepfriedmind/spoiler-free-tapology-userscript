# Spoiler-free Tapology

Hide results on [Tapology.com](https://www.tapology.com/) fighter/event/search pages.  

All results/records are hidden by default.

On fighter pages, you can click the `+` icon to expand and show the results. Clicking "Show bout details" in the filter section will toggle results for all fights.

On event pages, you can click and hold on an individual bout to reveal the results or use the "Hide all results" toggle above. These pages normally have the winner in the left column and the loser in the right one, so I've made it randomized who is on the left/right on every page load.

If you see blurred-out text or ⚠️ you can click and hold to view the info.
